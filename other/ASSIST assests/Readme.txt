EMAIL DESCRIBING ASSESTS FROM HEATHER LOWTER

****

Hi Tom

Apologies… in haste… Please find the logo versions attached in png format. I also have them in EPS if required. The font used in the logo is Century Gothic regular.

The colours in the logo are: (showing RGB codes)
Green – R141/G198/B63
Orange – R251/G176/B64
Brown – R155/G133/B121
Blue – R100/G200/B208

And the burnt orange background colour we use in leaflets is attached as a PDF:

Hope this helps, come back to me if you need anything else.

Best wishes

Heather
